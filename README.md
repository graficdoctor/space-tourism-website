## Overview

### The challenge

- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This course is a perfect guide to **continued development**. I decided to follow this, so I could get more familiar using _utility classes_, how to name your classes and a more complete approach to writing CSS.
It has given me a lot of new information I will be implementing from now on. Or at least try to. Because it was nevertheless a tough exercise and there is a lot to be digested.
